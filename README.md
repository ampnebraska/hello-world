Assignment 1 DSC 520 
Hi My name is Angela Prebyl. I am born and raised in Beatrice, Nebraska.  I attended the University of Nebraska where I majored in Biological Sciences and Psychology and competed in the triple jump.  I completed my Masters in Applied Behavioral Analysis and realized what I really enjoyed about each of these fields was Data.  I look forward to learning more.
